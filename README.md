Assignment 3 for large scale data analysis, using mlflow.
If conda is in path and mlflow is installed this project can be run using
```
mlflow run https://github.com/TimSP98/flow
```
which will create a run locally and store metrics, parameters and the model.
The model in this case is a very basic Decision Tree.
